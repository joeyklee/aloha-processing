                    <li>Download <a href="https://processing.org/download/">Processing</a> for your specific operating system.</li>
                    <li>The confidence, curiosity and enthusiasm to learn and the drive to teach yourself and the patience to help those around you.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>What you need to do:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do the <a href="http://hello.processing.org/">One hour of code</a> with Dan Shiffman to get familiar with Processing and the concepts we'll dive further into today.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>In this workshop we will be introduced to <a href="https://processing.org">Processing</a> - a programming language and environment developed "to promote literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology". Processing is used across a variety of communities but has had particular success within the art and design community (and data visualization community) for its strength in generating visual and interactive output.
            </section>
            <section>
                We will will use Processing to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Become familiar with the fundamental concepts of programming visual outputs with code.</li>
                    <li>Build our confidence in using code as a material/tool to turn our ideas into something tangible.</li>
                    <li>Learn about the process of deconstructing tasks into modular steps (don't worry if this doesn't mean anything to you yet!).</li>
                    <li>Get introduced to the ways in which code can create accountability for the visualization process.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We will use the concepts learned in this workshop throughout the rest of the course to learn how to systematically approach data visualization problems and explore other tools and methods of producing visuals with data.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Learning Outcome / Assignment:</h3>
                <p> For your assignment choose <strong>one</strong> these three Proun drawings by El Lissitzsky.</p>

                <p>You will develop <strong>2 versions</strong>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The first will be a version as close to the image as possible.</li>
                    <li>The second will be a <strong>remix</strong> of the image - playing with the composition through the use of alternative colors, strokeWeight, object positioning, etc. - save your code in a separate file!</li>

                <h2>S2. Introduction to Processing</h2>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>"Processing is for writing software to make images, animations, and interactions. The idea is to write a single line of code, and have a circle show up on the screen. Add a few more lines of code, and the circle follows the mouse. Another line of code, and the circle changes color when the mouse is pressed. We call this sketching with code. You write one line, then add another, then another, and so on. The result is a program created one piece at a time. " - Casey Reas &amp; Ben Fry, <em>Getting Started With Processing</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>"Processing relates software concepts to principles of visual form, motion, and interaction. It integrates a programming language, development environment, and teaching methodology into a unified system. Processing was created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context, to serve as a software sketchbook, and to be used as a production tool. Students, artists, design professionals, and researchers use it for learning, prototyping, and production" - Casey Reas, <em>Processing, A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>"Software is a unique medium with unique qualities... Every programming language is a distinct material...Sketching is necessary for the development of ideas...Programming is not just for engineers..." - Casey Reas, <em>Processing, A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>In the last 10 years, Processing has become one of the most used tools for creating visual outputs (among other things). It has a wide usership in many communities, one being the data visualization community because it allows for flexible and custom exploration of data, it is powerful in dealing with large datasets, and has a relatively friendly syntax and large user community.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>S3. The Community</h2>
                <p>The ethos of Processing is to create an open environment to engage with technology. There's an active community of artists, designers, and scientists from all different domains helping to develop the language &amp; make Processing more accessible. If you continue to work in Processing, you'll definitely find lots of examples and support to help turn your ideas into something tangible. These are some photos of the people that are helping to make Processing bigger, better, and easier to learn.

                <h2>A static sketch</h2>

            	<h2>A dynamic sketch</h2>
            	<p>A dynamic sketch makes use of Processing's <strong>setup()</strong> and <strong>draw()</strong> functions to structure a logic for <strong>interaction</strong> and <strong>animations</strong>.</p>

            	<p>Together they look something like this:</p>

            	<p><img width="600" src="assets/img/setup&amp;draw.png" alt="" /></p>

            	<center> credits: "Learning Processing" - Shiffman </center>
            </section>

            <section>
            <p><strong>A Responsive Ellipse-drawing tool</strong><br>
            <img width="250" src="assets/img/dynamic-sketch.png" alt="" /></p>
            	<p>Run this in your PDE and we'll break it down line-by-line:</p>

            	<pre><code>
void setup() {
    size(700, 500);
    background(255);
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    background(255);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,40,40);
}
            	            	</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p><strong>setup()</strong> Set up your sketch by calling all statements that only need to occur once during your drawing - this might be things like the size() of your canvas.</p>

            	<p><strong>draw()</strong> Continuously repeat the statements within this function - continually evaluate the statements in a loop, over and over and over, forever.</p>

            	<p>Here, the computer is continually asking, "is the mousePressed?", "how about now?", "and now?", "how about now?", for infinity. When you finally press the mouse, it will change the background color to white and "erase" the ellipses you've drawn, but only as long as your mouse is pressed.</p>

            	<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <strong>mousePressed</strong> is equal to <strong>TRUE</strong> whenever your mouse is pressed and <strong>FALSE</strong> otherwise. Therefore it is a <strong>variable</strong> which stores a <strong>boolean</strong> of either <strong>TRUE</strong> or <strong>FALSE</strong> in response to a mouse <strong>event</strong>.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>What the above example shows is:</p>

            	<ul>
            	<li>our basic understanding of <strong>conditional</strong> statement using the <strong>if statement</strong>.</li>
            	<li>the use of <strong>variables</strong> - in this case the <strong>in-built</strong> variables called <strong>mouseX</strong>, <strong>mouseY</strong>, and <strong>mousePressed</strong>.</li>
            	</ul>

            </section>

            <section>
            	
            	<h2>Dynamic Sketch Remix</h2>

            	<p>Take 5 minutes now and remix the code from the "dynamic sketch":</p>

            	<ul>
            	<li>add 1 more new shape that responds to your <strong>mouseX</strong> and <strong>mouseY</strong> and</li>
            	<li>Use the conditional to affect the color of the shapes by the <strong>mousePressed</strong>.</li>
            	</ul>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p>Here's a sample of a sketch that tracks the speed of your mouse in the X and Y direction and maps it to colored bars:</p>
            	<img width = "250" src="assets/img/mouse-speed.png" alt="" />

            	<pre><code>
void setup() {
  size( 700, 500);
  smooth();
  noStroke();
}

void draw() {
  if (mousePressed) {
    background(255);
    fill( 0, 0, 255);
  } else {
    // create a random fill with transparency
    fill(random(100), random(255), random(255), random(50, 100));
  }

  // make a variable for the radius which calculates a radius for the ellipse based on the speed of the mouse
  // mouseX is the current screen location of the mouse
  // pmouseX is the previous screen location of the mouse
  // thus the absolute difference of the current location minus the previous location is the speed
  int speedX = abs(mouseX-pmouseX );
  int speedY = abs(mouseY-pmouseY );
  // responsive bar
  rect(width*0.25, height*0.75, 30, speedY*-2);
  rect(width*0.25+30, height*0.75+15, speedX*2, 30);
}

            	<h3>Saving your work</h3>

            	<p>When you're programming, saving your work is super important. Let's save our first program.</p>

            	<ul>
            	<li>From the PDE, go to "save..."</li>
            	<li>Navigate to a folder called "Sketches" (or create one if there isn't already)</li>
            	<li>Save your work with a name that doesn't include spaces. The convention is to use "camel case" ,like:

            	<ul>
            	<li>"myFirstSketch"</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            	</ul>


            	<p>You'll notice when you  save your "sketch" the file type will be added to the end of whatever you called your progam. So if you named your project "myFirstSketch", you will see in your folder "myFirstSketch.pde". The ".pde" is the processing file type (similar to when you see a .csv or .py or .r or .xls, etc etc).</p>

            	<h2>S6.1: Structure</h2>

            	<p>Voltaire once said, "If you wish to converse with me, define your terms". In this section, we're going to define a number of terms so we can all speak the same language when refering to the different elements of a program.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>What you should learn and remember from this section are:</p>

            	<ol>
            	<li>comments</li>
            	<li>printing</li>
            	<li><strong>functions</strong> can have a number of <strong>parameters</strong> that are passed <strong>arguments</strong>

            	<ul>
            	<li>e.g. size() is a <strong>function</strong> that has two <strong>parameters</strong>: <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong>. We can pass 2 numbers in like 700 and 500 which are the <strong>arguments</strong>.</li>
            	</ul>

            	<h3>S6.1.1: comments</h3>

            	<p>Remember seeing those double forward slashes (//) in the programs above? these are called <strong>comments</strong> - they are invisible to the computer and do not get evaluated by the computer.</p>

            	<p>These are useful when programming to help you (and others who read your code) keep track of what's happening in your program and allows you to test different functions and statements.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p>We can use two methods of comments:</p>

            	<p>For <strong>single line comments</strong>: //</p>

            	<pre><code>
// fill(255, 0, 0);
// ellipse(250, 100, 50, 50);
            	</code></pre>

            	<p>OR</p>

            	<p><strong>Block comments</strong> for multiple lines of code:</p>

            	<pre><code>
/* 
fill(255, 0, 0);
ellipse(250, 100, 50, 50);
*/
            	</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p>TIP: We can use comments to help us structure our logical steps when writing code. For example:</p>

            	<pre><code>
// first set the canvas size

// next set the canvas color

// next draw a circle in the center of the canvas. Since the canvas is 700 pixels wide and 500 pixels tall, the center must be at (350, 250). 

// next draw a triangle about 1/3 the width of the canvas

// ...

            	<h3>S6.1.2: Printing to the console:</h3>

            	<p>The most basic way to get feedback from a computer is by "printing to the console." We can do this by using the <em>print()</em> or <em>println()</em> functions. The difference between <em>print()</em> and <em>println()</em> is that <em>print()</em> does not start a new line break after each function call. If this seems like a bunch of hogwash, try out the examples below :)</p>

            	<p><em>print()</em></p>

            	<pre><code>
print("Hello World");
print("My name is Joey");
print("It is raining outside");
            	</code></pre>

            	<p><em>println()</em></p>

            	<pre><code>
println("Hello World");
println("My name is Joey");
println("It is raining outside");
            	</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<h3>S6.1.3: functions</h3>

            	<p><strong>Functions</strong> allow you to draw shapes, set colors, calculate numbers, and to execute many other types of actions. A function’s name is usually a lowercase word followed by parentheses. Functions have <strong>parameters</strong> in which you fill in with <strong>arguments</strong>.</p>

            	<p>The comma-separated elements between the parentheses are the <strong>parameters</strong> that you fill with <strong>arguments</strong>, and they affect the way the function works. Some functions have no parameters and others have many. This program demonstrates the size() and background() functions.
            	cont.</p>
            </section>


            <section>
            	<pre><code>
// The size function has two parameters. 
//The first sets the width of the display window and the second sets the height
// the arguements here are 200, 200
size(200, 200);


// This version of the background function has one parameter.
// It sets the gray value for the background of the display window in the range of 0 (black) to 255 (white)
// the argument here is 102
background(102);
            	</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<h3>S6.1.4: expressions &amp; statements:</h3>


            	<p>Using an analogy to human languages, a software expression is like a phrase. Software expressions are often combinations of operators such as +, *, and / that operate on the values to their left and right. A software expression can be as basic as a single number or can be a long combination of elements. An expression always has a value, determined by evaluating its contents.</p>
            	<p>Expressions</p>
            	<pre><code>
// expression       // value
10 &lt; 50             true

// expression       // value
5*3                 15
            	</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>A Statement</p>
            	<p>A statement - composed of a set of expressions - is like a sentence that gets translated into machine readable code that instructs the computer to do something. For example we see that the collection of these expressions makes a statement (below) that tell the computer to do a particular task.</p>

            	<pre><code>
size(200, 200);     // Runs the size() function to set the canvas size
int x;              // Declares a new variable x as an integer type
x = 102;            // Assigns the value 102 to the variable x
background(x);      // Runs the background() function
            	</code></pre>

            	<h3>S6.2.1: coordinates</h3>

            	<p>The coordinate space of a Processing canvas is set using the <em>size()</em> function. The parameters for <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> sets the number of pixels that will be in the <em>x-coordinate</em> space and <em>y-coordinate</em> space.</p>
            	<p>The Processing canvas starts at (0,0) at the top-left corner of the canvas.</p>

            	<p>In Processing we can change the properties of the shapes to affect their fill color, stroke color, and drawing mode. Let's go over a few of them here:</p>

            	<h4>Basic Color properties</h4>

            	<p><em>If we use RGB color space</em>:</p>

            	<pre><code>
* value1 = red          (between 0 - 255)
* value2 = green        (between 0 - 255)
* value3 = blue         (between 0 - 255)
* alpha = transparency  (between 0 - 100)
            	</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p><em>Processing comes with a handy Color tool to select colors</em></p>

            	<p><img src="assets/img/colortool.png" alt="" /></p>

            </section>
            <section>
            	<p><strong>fill()</strong></p>

            	<pre><code>
fill(value1, value2, value3)
fill(value1, value2, value3, alpha)
            	</code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p><strong>noFill()</strong></p>

            	<p>Use the <em>noFill()</em> function if you don't want a fill color</p>

            	<pre><code>
size(700, 500);

// with fill
fill(242, 172, 20);
ellipse(width*0.25, height * 0.5, 150, 150);

// no fill
noFill();
ellipse(width*0.75, height * 0.5, 150, 150);
            	</code></pre>

            	<p><img width="400" src="assets/img/nofill.png" alt="" /></p>

            	<p>Experiment: make your own example using noFill() with another set of shapes like a triangle and rectangle.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<h4>Basic Stroke Properties</h4>

            	<p><strong>stroke()</strong></p>

            	<pre><code>
stroke(value1, value2, value3)
stroke(value1, value2, value3, alpha)
            	</code></pre>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p><strong>noStroke()</strong></p>

            	<p>Use the <em>noStroke()</em> function if you don't want a stroke color</p>

            	<pre><code>
size(700, 500);

// no stroke
noStroke();
fill(242, 172, 20);
ellipse(width*0.25, height * 0.5, 150, 150);

// black stroke
stroke(0);
fill(242, 172, 20);
ellipse(width*0.75, height * 0.5, 150, 150);

            </section>

            <section>
            	<p><strong>strokeWeight()</strong></p>

            	<p>You can use the <em>strokeWeight()</em> function to change the width of the stroke.</p>
            	            	            	<pre><code>
size(700, 500);

strokeWeight(1);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.25, width*0.75, height * 0.25); 

strokeWeight(3);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.35, width*0.75, height * 0.35); 

strokeWeight(5);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.45, width*0.75, height * 0.45); 

strokeWeight(7);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.55, width*0.75, height * 0.55);

strokeWeight(9);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.65, width*0.75, height * 0.65);

strokeWeight(10);
line(width*0.25, height * 0.75, width*0.75, height * 0.75);

            <h3>S6.2.4: custom shapes</h3>

            <p>In Processing we can create our own shapes from a series of vertices. We can do by sandwiching a series of <em>vertex(x,y)</em> functions in between the <em>beginShape()</em> and <em>endShape()</em> functions.</p>
            </section>
            <section>

            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>What is data? Data could be anything from the time of day, the location of a bus stop, the color of your hair, and even the location of your mouse on the screen and the keys you pressed to login to your email. In general, data often consists of measurements of physical characteristics whether it be a digital photo of your dog or the precipitation in Vancouver.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>Processing can store, modify, and manipulate many different kinds of data, including numbers, letters, words, colors, images, fonts, and boolean values (true, false).</p>

            	<p>One of the key features of programming is the ability to store values and/or data to variables. Below are the main data types in Processing - and programming in general - and examples of how to store them to a variable in Processing. NOTE: Processing (the java version) is strongly typed and thus we must declare what the data type will be when assigning data to a variable. If this sounds crazy, have a look at the examples below :)</p>

            	<p>In the earlier examples we saw the use of variables like <strong>mouseX</strong>, <strong>mouseY</strong> , and <strong>mousePressed</strong>. What we know about these variables is that they <strong>store data</strong> like the <strong>location of the x- and y- coordinate of the mouse</strong> or if the <strong>mouse is pressed</strong>.</p>

            <h2>if/else statements</h2>
            	<p>Conditionals allow a program to make decisions about which lines of code run and which do not. They let actions take place only when a specific condition is met. Conditionals allow a program to behave differently depending on the values of their variables.</p>
            	<p>if/else statements are ways to control the behavior of your program. This allows us to make decisions about what happens in our code. if/else statements might allow us to filter out data, change the size of an ellipse or rectangle depending on the value of a variable, or react to a mouse or key input (oooh fancy!).</p>

            	<p>Computers are excellent at executing repetitive tasks accurately and quickly. Modern computers are also logic machines. Building on the work of the logicians Leibniz and Boole, modern computers use logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT to determine which lines of code are run and which are not.</p>

            	<h3>S8.3.1:The for loop</h3>

            	<p>The <strong>for loop</strong> is probably the coolest thing since ever. At the most basic level for loops allow your to repeat a statement or statements over and over again until a condition is met.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<p>Why are for loops so awesome? Let's look at an example of how a loop can be used to take a program which takes 14 lines of code to make 14 lines...</p>

            	<pre><code>
// original hard-coded program
size(200, 200);
line(20, 20, 20, 180);
line(30, 20, 30, 180);
line(40, 20, 40, 180);
line(50, 20, 50, 180);
line(60, 20, 60, 180);
line(70, 20, 70, 180);
line(80, 20, 80, 180);
line(90, 20, 90, 180);
line(100, 20, 100, 180);
line(110, 20, 110, 180);
line(120, 20, 120, 180);
line(130, 20, 130, 180);
line(140, 20, 140, 180);
            	</code></pre>

            </section>
            <section>
            	<p>... and make the program 4 lines of code:</p>

            	<pre><code>
size(200, 200);
for (int i = 20; i &lt; 150; i += 10) {
  line(i, 20, i, 180);
}
            	</code></pre>
            	<p>If you were to read this out loud it would sound like: "for the integer i equals 20, as long as i is less than 80, increment i by 5, drawing a line each time with new y coordinates based on i."</p>

            <section>
            	<p>Let's get a little crazy and make a nested loop. A nested loop? You can do that?! Sure!</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            	<pre><code>size(400, 400);
            	noStroke();

            	for (int i = 20; i &lt; width - 20; i += 20) {
            	  for (int j = 20; j &lt; height - 20; j += 20) {
            	        fill(random(255), random(255), random(255));
            	        ellipse(i, j, 10, 10);
            	    }
            	}
            	</code></pre>

            	<p><img width = "250" src="assets/img/processing_nestedLoop.png" alt="" /></p>

            	<p>How does a nested loop work? First, the outer loop starts. Then the inner loop runs until the condition is met at which point the outer loop increments, repeating the inner loop again until the condition is met at which point the outer loop increments, and over and over until the outer loop condition is met. This means that columns of ellipses are drawn from left to right with each complete loop.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
            	<p>*NOTE: the random() function generates a random number from 0 to the value of the input parameter. In this case, for each iteration in the loop, a random number is generated between 0 and 255 for each parameter in the fill() function.</p>

            	<li>We learned a lot of things today, but it certainly is only the tip of iceberg. There are tons of more functions and programmatic control structures we didn't get into today. It will be up to you to learn more about these things. There are a ton of great resources out there which are listed in the references section bewow.</li>
            	<li>Here's a list of some of the major things I think we didn't cover today:

            	<ul>
            	<li>Different renderers (e.g. P3D, OPENGL, etc)</li>
            	<li>While loops</li>
            	<li>reading in tables, dictionaries, JSON</li>
            	<li>Reading and writing files</li>
            	<li>exporting to PDF or saving frames as PNG</li>
            	<li>sharing your sketch online</li>
            	<li>and the list goes on and on... :)</li>
            	</ul>
            	</li>
            	</ul>

            	<h2>Endless learning</h2>

            	<p>There's so much more to learn and so much cool stuff we haven't yet done with data! Throughout the course I hope you can reference back to this workshop as you learn more about Processing and as a way to help you understand some of the other tools we will be using like R or Mapbox Studio, and others.</p>

            <section>
            	<h2>P5.js</h2>

            	<p>I have to mention P5.js which is the javascript library inspired by Processing not only because it is super cool, but because I, along with many others, believe the age of the web is here!  P5.js is a javascript library that takes the soul of Processing and implements it in javascript meaning that you can sketch with code using web technologies (html, css, &amp; javascript). I would argue that the syntax is friendlier and is more flexible in terms of sharing your work. Besides the fact that the browser can crash if you send it a ton of data, P5.js may be an interesting way to move out of your desktop and onto the web.</p>

            	<p>*NOTE: I decided not to teach P5.js since I thought introducing html, css, and javascript would be maybe too much for the first class. Please let me know if you have other thoughts!</p>
