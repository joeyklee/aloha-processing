# Programming Art Assignment:
At the end of this workshop, you will be equipped with the fundamental tools to draw with code. With your new skills you will be able to produce all sorts of visual output using Processing's primitive shapes and programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops. For your assignment choose **one** these three Proun drawings by El Lissitzsky.

You will develop **2 versions**: 

1. The first will be a version as close to the image as possible.
2. The second will be a **remix** of the image - playing with the composition through the use of alternative colors, strokeWeight, object positioning, etc. - save your code in a separate file!

Be sure to try and use **variables** -- ones that you define and in-built variables like **mouseX** and **mouseY** -- to affect the composition.

**NOTE:** You are encouraged to work together on the initial composition, but your **remixes** should all look different.

**Turning in the assignment**:

* create a blog (that you create from wordpress, tublr, cargo collective, blogspot, etc)
* you will post your **two images** AND **your code** to your blog.
* send the link to your blog to Joey and Sally.
* Watch the video below to successfully copy your Procesing copy to your blog such that it is formatted with syntax highlighting
